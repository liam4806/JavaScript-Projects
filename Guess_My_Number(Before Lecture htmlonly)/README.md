# What have done
This code is built by myself without watching a solution course yet. I just look what I need to achieve and put it on action.
This version is interacted with html only. Not CSS yet.
Things I did:

1. Click 'again' will reset the secretnumber. O 
2. Click 'check' will make score lower O
3. Display the Highscore O
4. If the number is right, the message should change O
5. Add lower/higher message to help user find out the number. O

### New Update 04/23/2023
+ Implement changes on CSS when we got a correct number
+ Add a bumper function for score to prevent going lower than 0
+ Made a function for duplicating messages to make a code cleaner
