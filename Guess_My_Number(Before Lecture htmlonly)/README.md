This code is built by myself without watching a solution course yet. I just look what I need to achieve and put it on action.
This version is interacted with html only. Not CSS yet.
Things I did:
1.Click 'again' will reset the secretnumber. O 
2.Click 'check' will make score lower O
3.Display the Highscore O
4.If the number is right, the message should change O
5.Add lower/higher message to help user find out the number. O
