# My First JS Project
I code this only based on what I've learned and which features are required without watching solution video.
CSS manipulation is not included on first version since I didn't learn it yet
Thing to do:
+ Click again will reset the secretnumber. 
+ Click check will make score lower.
+ Click should append all scores and display the Highscore of it. 
+ If the number is right, the message should change. 

### Update 04/23/2023
+ Made a function for message to make a clean code
+ Add bumper function for preventing the score going lower than 0
+ Add CSS changes when we got a correct number
